# Capstone-Project-Using-AWS-Archtitecture-

In this capstone project, a comprehensive AWS architecture migration plan was developed to address critical performance and security issues plaguing a data-center-bound e-commerce web application. The existing infrastructure suffered from limited scalability, causing significant performance bottlenecks during peak traffic periods. Additionally, the application was vulnerable to brute-force attacks due to inadequate security measures.

Through this AWS migration below objectives achieved:

Improved Scalability: Leveraging AWS's elastic compute resources EC2 Auto Scaling, Lambda functions to dynamically adjust capacity based on demand, ensuring optimal performance during peak loads.
Enhanced Performance: Implementing content delivery networks (CloudFront) for faster content distribution, database optimization techniques (RDS, DynamoDB) to reduce query latency, and caching mechanisms to minimize server load.
Strengthened Security: Integrating AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) to mitigate brute-force and other web-based attacks, utilizing AWS Shield for DDoS protection, and employing Identity and Access Management (IAM) to enforce granular access controls.
Cost Optimization: Analyzing usage patterns and implementing cost-saving measures like reserved instances or spot instances to reduce operational expenses.
By migrating to AWS, the e-commerce application is poised to achieve a more resilient, scalable, and secure architecture, capable of delivering a seamless user experience even under high traffic conditions. The project demonstrates the power of cloud computing in transforming legacy applications into modern, high-performance platforms.
